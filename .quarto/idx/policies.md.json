Group learning and discussion are key aspects of this course. This means that we all need to do our part to be prepared for each class, and to foster a positive and inquisitive learning environment.\n\nIn between classes you should:\n\n- Review your notes from previous classes\n- Read the assigned readings for that day\n- Refer to this site for updates to the [schedule](schedule.qmd)\n- Leave yourself enough time to read and complete assignments\n- DO NOT wait until the last minute to begin your assignments\n- Revise and proofread your writing before turning it in\n- EMAIL your instructor with any questions. Ask lots of questions!\n\nEach class must create its own learning community as the result of shared efforts on the part of all members. It is your responsibility as a member of this learning community to help your fellow students by attending class and turning in assignments on time. If you must miss a class or turn in an assignment late, please let me know beforehand so that we may work out a way for you to make up the work. You do *not* need a doctor's note or other written excuse, but please let me know if there are special circumstances that may prevent you from completing a large amount of coursework.\n\n### Attendance & Participation\n\nGood participation should be understood as consistent and thoughtful contribution to the classroom community, an engagement with course materials and conversations, and a general responsiveness to (and respect for) one’s fellow students and instructor. This isn’t an accounting of how often you speak in class. Instead, it’s about what you offer to the intellectual life of the class, and everyone contributes to this on-going work in different ways.\n\nYou'll get participation credit simply for attending class and doing the work with care. Some days the full class will meet for the entire time, and other days we will meet in groups for only part of the class. You are responsible to attend all of your group times as well as all of the full-class sessions.\n\n**You can miss 5 class sessions without penalty, and you don't need to contact me if you have missed or will miss a class**. This is a generous policy that should cover absences due to illness, sports, academic trips, interviews, etc. If you have a special case, such as having to isolate due to COVID, contact me as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, if you miss more than 5 classes, you will be marked down one grade \"step\" for each additional class missed. (For example, if you miss six classes and your final grade is 90% (A-), your sixth absence will cause you to have a B+ instead.) There are no “excused” absences, so you do not need to contact me if you have missed or will miss a class. You will be marked absent regardless of your reason for missing class.\n\nThough you're not required to, you can always reach out to me or a classmate to find out what you missed. We're all in this together, and I'll do my best to make sure no one falls behind.\n\n#### Longer Absences\n\nThe guidelines above apply to typical short absences (missing just one class in a row and catching up on work as normal). However, I recognize that COVID and other issues may lead to an *extended* absence, when you might be out of class for several classes in a row, or even a week or more.\n\nIn these cases, **it's your responsibility to contact me as soon as you know you'll be out**. Let me know how long you expect the absence to be, and we can talk through what some of the expectations will be during this time and how you will complete the work.\n\nIt's important that you attend class as much as you can, but it's also important that you stay home if you're sick and get the care you need. We can work on this balance together, and if you have any questions you can always ask me!\n\n#### Instructor Absence\n\nIf I have to miss class due to illness or any other reason, I will let you know as soon as possible via email. I'll also post any relevant materials on Sakai or on this website, and my email will let you know what you need to do. It's a good idea to check your email at least once a day, since that's the primary way I'll keep in touch about any changes to the schedule.\n\n### Lateness and Extensions\n\nAll assignments are due by the start of each class. I know that things don't always go according to plan. If you need an extension, simply ask for one (by email), and you'll almost always receive it. You don't need an excuse to receive an extension!\n\nHowever, you **must ask for the extension *at least* 24 hours before the assignment deadline**. To request an extension, simply [fill out this form](https://forms.office.com/r/CvgQqWDz4B), where you will propose a new deadline for the assignment (a good rule of thumb is a day or two after the original deadline). Any work received late (less than 48 hours) without an agreed-upon extension will receive a point deduction.\n\nBut keep in mind: **I cannot accept any assignment more than 48 hours late.** Assignments more than 48 hours late will receive a 0.\n\n### Academic Honesty and Integrity\n\nIn this course, as in all courses, you are expected to adhere to W&J's standards of academic honesty and integrity. You should refer to the College Catalog on MyW&J for the details of this policy and how cases of academic misconduct are handled.\n\nIn general, when completing writing assignments, ensure all work is your own, and give credit where it is due in your citations. Likewise do not collaborate on quizzes, tests, or homework assignments unless explicitly granted permission. This includes generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) or other technologies that write for you---do not use these unless explicitly granted permission to do so. If you have any concerns about whether you might have plagiarized (e.g., if you’re not sure about some particular rule), please get in touch with me immediately---I will gladly discuss the matter with you.\n\n### Names and Pronouns\n\nEveryone has the right to be addressed as they feel most comfortable. It’s hard to learn if you cringe every time I call on you or address you in communication. I will ask everyone at the beginning of the semester to tell me their preferred name, pronunciation, and the pronouns they use. I will do my very best to get it right.  Please do not feel the need to change your name or pronouns to “make it easy” for me, and please correct me if I get it wrong! This policy goes for everyone---use the names and pronouns dictated by the person to whom they belong. Also, our personal growth does not always align with the semester system: If your name or pronoun changes part way through the class, please send me an update!\n\n### Class Technology\n\nPlease be respectful with your use of laptops and technology in class. I request that you only use them for class related purposes, as I and others may find them distracting (For example, no email or social media should be open in your browser tabs!). Cell phones should be kept silent and put away, and you can expect the same from me.\n\n### Email Response Time\n\nI encourage you to email me anytime with questions or thoughts about the class. It can sometimes take me up to 24 hours to respond to your message, but I will do my best to get back to you within that period. On the weekends (Friday 5pm–Monday 9am), the response time is 48 hours. This means that if you have a question about an assignment that you email to me the night before something is due, I may not be able to get back to you until after the assignment was due. In these cases, it’s best to plan ahead. But don't hesitate to email whenever you have a question, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!\n\n## Important Resources for this Class and Your College Journey\n\n### Mental Health\n\nWhat we do in college is not easy, on many fronts. Students are challenged with feelings of depression, anxiety, and self harm at astonishingly high rates. Learning is hard, and you will likely be challenged in college in ways that you haven’t experienced before. Learning while life is hard is even harder. Please take care of yourself. Drink water, eat well, and get more than seven hours of sleep. Have some hobbies, but don’t feel the need to do *everything*. If you are feeling depressed, withdrawn, anxious, like an impostor, or you are having specific problems with harassment, assault, bias, etc., please seek help. There are many resources on campus, and my door and email are always open.\n\nW&J faculty and staff recognize that mental or physical health concerns can affect any of us, and sometimes make it difficult for students to manage their academics or daily life.  If you find yourself struggling this semester, please let me know.  I am one of many people here at W&J who care about you and your welfare.\n\nPlease also consider contacting the Student Health & Counseling Center (724) 223-6107 or the 24/7/365 Counseling Support Line (833) 434-1217, for support if you’re feeling stressed, overwhelmed, anxious, depressed, lost, or are struggling with personal issues.  Services are free and confidential.\n\nStudents have access to free, confidential in-the-moment counseling, self-help, and meditation programs including the prepaid version of HeadSpace, and online therapy options via (833) 434-1217 or the CampusWell app that you can download to your phone.\n\n### Disability Support Services\n\nWashington & Jefferson College is committed to providing academic accommodations for students with disabilities. This includes individuals with physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental health disorders that meet the definition of a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students who plan to request accommodations should contact the Director for Academic Success as early as possible, although requests may be made at any time. To determine whether you qualify for accommodations, or if you have questions about services and procedures, please call 724-223-6008 or send an email to dss@washjeff.edu.\n\n### W&J Library\n\nI highly recommend that you make use of the W&J Library resources while navigating your essays this semester. That includes not only primary literature, access to databases, and book references, but also the friendly members of the library staff. They are excellent resources for finding information efficiently, or learning what you can access through W&J subscriptions that might not be freely available on the internet. The W&J Library homepage is <https://libguides.washjeff.edu/home>.\n\n### Writing Center\n\nStaffed by student Peer Writing Tutors, the Writing Center is a free resource available to all W&J students. Writing Tutors from many majors help writers one-on-one in all phases of the writing process, from deciphering assignments, to discussing ideas, to developing an argument, to finalizing a draft. Because proofreading is a last step in that process, you should leave plenty of time (like at least a week) for getting your ideas right before expecting proofreading help. Consultants also can help writers with personal documents, like job and internship applications. The Center welcomes student writers with all varieties of backgrounds and college preparation, including multilingual writers. Please visit the Writing Center's page (<https://mywj.washjeff.edu/office/writing-center>) on MyW&J for specific information regarding hours of availability and how to schedule an appointment. \n\n### Cautions regarding copyright and licensing\n\nAll documents provided to you (i.e. syllabus, paper prompts, tests, etc...) are the property of the instructor or author. It is a violation of intellectual property to post these online (especially to websites promoting copying/cheating) or to provide them to students not in our class or in future classes. Your papers are your property, and while you can do with them as you wish, it may be a violation of academic integrity to make them available to others who might use them for plagiarism. Basically, keep course materials and your work to yourself except in the process of editing and peer review.\n\n### Inclusion and Diversity\n\nThis course is open to anyone interested in the history of information and technology. It is my intent to make all students feel welcome and served in this course by addressing their learning needs. We all (including myself) are continuously learning about different lived experiences. In this course, if you encounter anything said (intentionally or unintentionally) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. If your learning is impacted by your background, or any life event going on outside of class, feel free to talk to me. Even if you choose not to share details, I would be happy to direct you to the right resources on campus.\n\nThis semester we will address topics which may be emotionally difficult. I acknowledge that each of you has their own specific life history, family context, identity, body—and that these realities have an impact on how you understand and interact with our course materials. Therefore, I ask you to generally familiarize yourself with the content of our discussions ahead of time, and if for any reason you believe you will be unable to participate in a discussion of certain themes or elements, please contact me beforehand and/or seek the support of any of the formal or informal resources available to you on campus, some of which are included in this syllabus. I look forward to creating a safe learning environment together this semester!\n\n## Grading Scale\n\nLetter Grade|Point Total\n---|---\nA|93-100\nA-|90-92\nB+|87-89\nB|83-86\nB-|80-82\nC+|77-79\nC|73-76\nC-|70-72\nD+|67-69\nD|63-66\nD-|60-62\nF|<60\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Shared Expectations for this Class\n\n### Preparation and Pacing\n\nWe will cover a lot of material during the semester, and you will have many opportunities to discuss complex ideas with your peers and think about many of the core questions of information overload.
