**Complete by: Friday 26 Sept. at class time**

Write a 750-word personal narrative that relates a time when you felt information overload and how it affected you. You can think of this assignment as a twist on the classic [literacy narrative](https://writingcraft.commons.gc.cuny.edu/literacy-essay-examples/) genre, except that it's focused on information literacy and on a moment when you felt overwhelmed by technology and/or information.

A successful narrative will (1) have a hook that draws the reader in, (2) talk about a specific experience in detail, and (3) connect that experience to the larger themes of information overload we've been learning about the class. Think about the ways that Chiang connects the personal and interstellar scales in *The Story of Your Life* as an example.

## Requirements
