**Complete by: the end of the semester**

## Participating in Class (30 pts)

Good participation should be understood as consistent and thoughtful contribution to the classroom community, an engagement with course materials and conversations, and a general responsiveness to (and respect for) one’s fellow students and instructor. This isn’t an accounting of how often you speak in class. Instead, it’s about what you offer to the intellectual life of the class, and everyone contributes to this on-going work in different ways.

## Attending Days with Visitors (10pts)

There will be several days in class when we have visitors who will share information about the college and various services around campus. You'll get points simply for being present and attentive on those days. If you miss one of those sessions, you won't get those points. (Note: you can use any of these days as one of your 5 allowed absences, but then you will lose the points for attending a visitor day.)

## Completing In-Class Work (30pts)

We'll have various kinds of in-class work to complete throughout the semester. The best example of this is the 4-year course plans you'll create, but this also includes things like sample emails. You'll get these points simply for being present and completing the in-class work in good faith.

## Attending Campus Events (30pts)

The last part of this assignment is designed to help you get to know the campus and all the different kinds of things there are to do here. You should go to three events over the course of the semester, one in each of three categories: an arts and culture event, a student sporting event (*not* for a team that you're on), and a scholarly lecture. You'll often get college-wide emails about upcoming events, and if I hear of any coming up I'll try to let you know about them. To get the points for each event, simply take a selfie of yourself at the event (with something identifying in the picture like a program or a scoreboard) and email it to me. This is a nice way to get some free points and bolster your participation grade.
