Ask lots of questions!\n\nEach class must create its own learning community as the result of shared efforts on the part of all members. It is your responsibility as a member of this learning community to help your fellow students by attending class and turning in assignments on time. If you must miss a class or turn in an assignment late, please let me know beforehand so that we may work out a way for you to make up the work. You do not need a doctor’s note or other written excuse, but please let me know if there are special circumstances that may prevent you from completing a large amount of coursework.\n\n\n\nGood participation should be understood as consistent and thoughtful contribution to the classroom community, an engagement with course materials and conversations, and a general responsiveness to (and respect for) one’s fellow students and instructor. This isn’t an accounting of how often you speak in class. Instead, it’s about what you offer to the intellectual life of the class, and everyone contributes to this on-going work in different ways.\nYou’ll get participation credit simply for attending class and doing the work with care. You are responsible to attend all of the class sessions.\nYou can miss 5 class sessions without penalty, and you don’t need to contact me if you have missed or will miss a class. This is a generous policy that should cover absences due to illness, sports, academic trips, interviews, etc. If you have a special case, such as having to isolate due to COVID, contact me as soon as possible.\nHowever, if you miss more than 5 classes, you will be marked down one grade “step” for each additional class missed. (For example, if you miss six classes and your final grade is 90% (A-), your sixth absence will cause you to have a B+ instead.) There are no “excused” absences, so you do not need to contact me if you have missed or will miss a class. You will be marked absent regardless of your reason for missing class.\nThough you’re not required to, you can always reach out to me or a classmate to find out what you missed. We’re all in this together, and I’ll do my best to make sure no one falls behind.\n\n\nThe guidelines above apply to typical short absences (missing just one class in a row and catching up on work as normal). However, I recognize that COVID and other issues may lead to an extended absence, when you might be out of class for several classes in a row, or even a week or more.\nIn these cases, it’s your responsibility to contact me as soon as you know you’ll be out. Let me know how long you expect the absence to be, and we can talk through what some of the expectations will be during this time and how you will complete the work.\nIt’s important that you attend class as much as you can, but it’s also important that you stay home if you’re sick and get the care you need. We can work on this balance together, and if you have any questions you can always ask me!\n\n\n\nIf I have to miss class due to illness or any other reason, I will let you know as soon as possible via email. I’ll also post any relevant materials on Sakai or on this website, and my email will let you know what you need to do. It’s a good idea to check your email at least once a day, since that’s the primary way I’ll keep in touch about any changes to the schedule.\n\n\n\n\nAll assignments are due by the start of each class. I know that things don’t always go according to plan. If you need an extension, simply ask for one (by email), and you’ll almost always receive it. You don’t need an excuse to receive an extension!\nHowever, you must ask for the extension at least 24 hours before the assignment deadline. To request an extension, simply fill out this form, where you will propose a new deadline for the assignment (a good rule of thumb is a day or two after the original deadline). Any work received late (less than 48 hours) without an agreed-upon extension will receive a point deduction.\nBut keep in mind: I cannot accept any assignment more than 48 hours late. Assignments more than 48 hours late will receive a 0.\n\n\n\nIn this course, as in all courses, you are expected to adhere to W&J’s standards of academic honesty and integrity. You should refer to the College Catalog on MyW&J for the details of this policy and how cases of academic misconduct are handled.\nIn general, when completing writing assignments, ensure all work is your own, and give credit where it is due in your citations. Likewise do not collaborate on quizzes, tests, or homework assignments unless explicitly granted permission. This includes generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) or other technologies that write for you—do not use these unless explicitly granted permission to do so. If you have any concerns about whether you might have plagiarized (e.g., if you’re not sure about some particular rule), please get in touch with me immediately—I will gladly discuss the matter with you.\n\n\n\nEveryone has the right to be addressed as they feel most comfortable. It’s hard to learn if you cringe every time I call on you or address you in communication. I will ask everyone at the beginning of the semester to tell me their preferred name, pronunciation, and the pronouns they use. I will do my very best to get it right. Please do not feel the need to change your name or pronouns to “make it easy” for me, and please correct me if I get it wrong! This policy goes for everyone—use the names and pronouns dictated by the person to whom they belong. Also, our personal growth does not always align with the semester system: If your name or pronoun changes part way through the class, please send me an update!\n\n\n\nPlease be respectful with your use of laptops and technology in class. I request that you only use them for class related purposes, as I and others may find them distracting (For example, no email or social media should be open in your browser tabs!). Cell phones should be kept silent and put away, and you can expect the same from me.\n\n\n\nI encourage you to email me anytime with questions or thoughts about the class. It can sometimes take me up to 24 hours to respond to your message, but I will do my best to get back to you within that period. On the weekends (Friday 5pm–Monday 9am), the response time is 48 hours. This means that if you have a question about an assignment that you email to me the night before something is due, I may not be able to get back to you until after the assignment was due. In these cases, it’s best to plan ahead. But don’t hesitate to email whenever you have a question, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can!"

    "text": "Important Resources for this Class and Your College Journey\n\nMental Health\nWhat we do in college is not easy, on many fronts. Students are challenged with feelings of depression, anxiety, and self harm at astonishingly high rates. Learning is hard, and you will likely be challenged in college in ways that you haven’t experienced before. Learning while life is hard is even harder. Please take care of yourself. Drink water, eat well, and get more than seven hours of sleep. Have some hobbies, but don’t feel the need to do everything. If you are feeling depressed, withdrawn, anxious, like an impostor, or you are having specific problems with harassment, assault, bias, etc., please seek help. There are many resources on campus, and my door and email are always open.\nW&J faculty and staff recognize that mental or physical health concerns can affect any of us and sometimes make it difficult for students to manage their academics or daily life. If you find yourself struggling this semester, please let me know. I am one of many people here at W&J who care about you and your welfare.\n\nPlease also consider contacting the Crabtree Center for Student Wellbeing at (724) 223-6107 or scheduling online through MyW&J.\nThe Center for Wellbeing offers both in-person and telehealth counseling options if you’re feeling stressed, overwhelmed, anxious, depressed, lost, or are struggling with personal issues. Telehealth therapy can be accessed through our partnership with BetterMynd. These sessions are free and confidential.\nAs a student, you also have access to a 24/7/365 Counseling Support Line (844) 287-6963 if you need to speak to someone immediately.\n\n\n\nDisability Support Services\nTo serve our mission to promote academic excellence, Washington & Jefferson College is committed to providing appropriate accommodations for students with documented disabilities and complies with applicable state and federal laws. Students with disabilities include individuals with physical disabilities, learning disabilities and mental health disorders that meet the definition of a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students who plan to request accommodations should contact the Director for Academic Success as early as possible, although requests may be made at any time. To determine whether you qualify for accommodations, or if you have questions about services and procedures, contact the Director for Academic Success at 724-223-6008 or dss@washjeff.edu.\n\n\nW&J Library\nI highly recommend that you make use of the W&J Library resources while navigating your essays this semester. That includes not only primary literature, access to databases, and book references, but also the friendly members of the library staff. They are excellent resources for finding information efficiently, or learning what you can access through W&J subscriptions that might not be freely available on the internet. The W&J Library homepage is https://libguides.washjeff.edu/home.\n\n\nWriting Center\nStaffed by student Peer Writing Tutors, the Writing Center is a free resource available to all W&J students. Writing Tutors from many majors help writers one-on-one in all phases of the writing process, from deciphering assignments, to discussing ideas, to developing an argument, to finalizing a draft. Because proofreading is a last step in that process, you should leave plenty of time (like at least a week) for getting your ideas right before expecting proofreading help. Consultants also can help writers with personal documents, like job and internship applications. The Center welcomes student writers with all varieties of backgrounds and college preparation, including multilingual writers. Please visit the Writing Center’s page (https://mywj.washjeff.edu/office/writing-center) on MyW&J for specific information regarding hours of availability and how to schedule an appointment.\n\n\nCautions regarding copyright and licensing\nAll documents provided to you (i.e. syllabus, paper prompts, tests, etc…) are the property of the instructor or author. It is a violation of intellectual property to post these online (especially to websites promoting copying/cheating) or to provide them to students not in our class or in future classes. Your papers are your property, and while you can do with them as you wish, it may be a violation of academic integrity to make them available to others who might use them for plagiarism. Basically, keep course materials and your work to yourself except in the process of editing and peer review.\n\n\nInclusion and Diversity\nThis course is open to anyone interested in the history of information and technology. It is my intent to make all students feel welcome and served in this course by addressing their learning needs. We all (including myself) are continuously learning about different lived experiences. In this course, if you encounter anything said (intentionally or unintentionally) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. If your learning is impacted by your background, or any life event going on outside of class, feel free to talk to me. Even if you choose not to share details, I would be happy to direct you to the right resources on campus.\nThis semester we will address topics which may be emotionally difficult. I acknowledge that each of you has their own specific life history, family context, identity, body—and that these realities have an impact on how you understand and interact with our course materials. Therefore, I ask you to generally familiarize yourself with the content of our discussions ahead of time, and if for any reason you believe you will be unable to participate in a discussion of certain themes or elements, please contact me beforehand and/or seek the support of any of the formal or informal resources available to you on campus, some of which are included in this syllabus. I look forward to creating a safe learning environment together this semester!"

Then, you’ll research the topic and annotate the essays (using Microsoft Word comments) to show what the essays got right and what they got wrong. You should critique both the content and the style of these essays, keeping in mind our discussion of chatbots in class, as well as the Chiang reading.\nYou’ll also write a short (5-7 sentence) reflection on how these essays performed. Were these good essays or bad essays? Would you trust a chatbot to write an essay for you? Would you trust it if you thought other people were going to really believe that it was your writing?\nI’ll distribute essay prompts and more detailed instructions in class on Friday 10 Oct. You’ll complete this assignment entirely in class, but it will be calculated as a separate assignment grade."

You’ll often get college-wide emails about upcoming events, and if I hear of any coming up I’ll try to let you know about them.

This will also help you stay on track with the reading and be prepared for class.\nEach day that some reading is due, you’ll create a log entry for that reading. The entry might be for an entire reading or just a segment of something longer. Your log should be kept in a spreadsheet (Google Sheets or Excel is fine), and it should have the following columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nAuthor\nPublication Year\nPublisher/Publication\nChapter/Page Numbers\nSummary\nAssessment\n\n\n\n\nThe title of the book or article\nThe author’s name\nYear of publication, if available\nName of the publisher (e.g. Penguin Books) or the publication (e.g. The New York Times)\nThe chapters or pages you read for that day, if applicable\nA three-to-four sentence summarizing the plot and/or themes of what you read\nTwo-to-three sentences with your personal assessment of the reading\n\n\n\nYou’ll turn in the spreadsheet log on Sakai once at midterm and once at the end of the semester (see the deadlines above). If you’re using an online spreadsheet program like Google Sheets, you’ll need to download the spreadsheet file in order to send it on Sakai (do NOT send me a link to an online file). Your log will be graded on completeness and the clarity of your written summaries and assessments."

    "text": "Group Presentation: in class on Friday 5 Dec. or Monday 8 Dec.\nIndividual Essay: due Monday 8 Dec. at class time\nIn Station Eleven, Clark’s “Museum of Civilization” is an attempt to preserve and understand the past by collecting dead technologies. At different points in the novel, each of the characters wrestles with ways of preserving what came before while finding a new path forward. Over the course of the semester we’ve explored a long history of information overload and multiple intersecting traditions of people trying to come to terms with their tools, their past, and their future.\nThis assignment will be in two stages: a group presentation and an individual essay."

This will be easiest if it refers to a specific information technology, like the smartphone, the printing press, chatbots, novels, or television. Your essay should connect that technological anxiety to your chosen character. In what way do you see this character as reflecting the real-world feeling you’ve chosen to write about? What might the character’s actions in the novel teach us about responding to information overload?\nYour essay should be 1500-2000 words (put the wordcount in your header), use MLA citations and format, and be uploaded to Sakai as a PDF file."

Our day-to-day lives are saturated with information, and it can be overwhelming to process it all!\nThis class will explore the anxiety, exhaustion, and unease brought on by information technologies. We will trace emotional responses—in film, television, and literature—to technological change, from the shock of the printing press to the malaise of the smartphone. We’ll also think about what it means to process and filter information as a college student in 2025, with concrete strategies that you can take with you as you navigate information overload at W&J and beyond."
